# Using the Builder pattern for creating test data with ease

If you have yet to hear about [software] design patterns, you may think of them
as reusable solutions for everyday problems that work for different contexts. Of
course, new design patterns appear now and then, but there is a [well-documented
core of patterns][design-patterns] that are popular and can be seen in many
object-oriented code bases. The [Builder][builder] pattern is one of them.

Although this pattern may come in handy in multiple situations, it is especially
helpful when creating test data. Tests for any medium-large-sized applications
often require us to create various objects, put them in a particular state, and
have relationships with other entities. That can be hard to do, especially if
the objects are complex and we need to create many of them. The Builder pattern
offers a solution to use a more semantic, domain-specific interface that makes
the process easier.

For example, imagine we are coding a software system to help manage an
automobile repair shop. Not surprisingly, we may find mechanics and cars.
Mechanics can be responsible for multiple vehicles, be on holiday, and have
different hourly salaries. The following tests verify that we cannot assign a
car to a mechanic under certain circumstances.

```ts
import { Car, Mechanic } from "@domain";

describe("POST /mechanics/{id}/cars", () => {
  it("does not add a new car if the mechanic is on holiday", async () => {
    const mechanic = new Mechanic({
      id: 1,
      name: "Alice",
    });

    const today = new Date();

    const pto = new Pto({
      mechanic,
      startDate: startOfDay(today),
      endDate: endOfDay(today),
    });

    mechanic.ptos = [pto];

    await mechanicRepository.save(mechanic);

    const car = new Car({
      id: 1,
      make: "Mazda",
      model: "Mazda 3",
      year: 2021,
    });

    await carRepository.save(car);

    const response = await request(app)
      .post(`/mechanics/${mechanic.id}/cars`)
      .send({ carId: car.id });

    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });

  it("does not add a new car if the mechanic is working on five cars already", async () => {
    const mechanic = new Mechanic({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });

    mechanic.cars = [
      new Car({
        id: 1,
        make: "Mazda",
        model: "Mazda 2",
        year: 2021,
      }),
      new Car({
        id: 2,
        make: "Mazda",
        model: "Mazda 3",
        year: 2021,
      }),
      new Car({
        id: 3,
        make: "Mazda",
        model: "CX-30",
        year: 2021,
      }),
      new Car({
        id: 4,
        make: "Mazda",
        model: "MX-5",
        year: 2021,
      }),
      new Car({
        id: 5,
        make: "Mazda",
        model: "CX-60",
        year: 2021,
      }),
    ];

    await mechanicRepository.save(mechanic);

    const car = new Car({
      id: 6,
      make: "Mazda",
      model: "CX-9",
      year: 2021,
    });

    await carRepository.save(car);

    const response = await request(app)
      .post(`/mechanics/${mechanic.id}/cars`)
      .send({ carId: car.id });

    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });
});
```

As you may see in the code block above, creating all these objects by hand is
expensive and makes the whole test hard to read. Let‚Äôs try instead to use a
`MechanicBuilder` that makes the process easier while producing the same result.

```ts
import { MechanicBuilder, CarBuilder } from "@test/builders";

describe("POST /mechanics/{id}/cars", () => {
  it("does not add a new car if the mechanic is on holiday", async () => {
    const mechanic = await new MechanicBuilder()
      .onHoliday()
      .save(mechanicRepository);

    const car = await new CarBuilder().save(carRepository);

    const response = await request(app)
      .post(`/mechanics/${mechanic.id}/cars`)
      .send({ carId: car.id });

    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });

  it("does not add a new car if the mechanic is working on five cars already", async () => {
    const mechanic = await new MechanicBuilder()
      .withCars(5)
      .save(mechanicRepository);

    const car = await new CarBuilder().save(carRepository);

    const response = await request(app)
      .post(`/mechanics/${mechanic.id}/cars`)
      .send({ carId: car.id });

    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });
});
```

Reading the code above, we can clearly see the scenario we are creating for the
test. The builder reduces verbosity and makes the code more expressive while
favoring reusability for other test cases. Of course, we may keep adding methods
to the `MechanicBuilder` as new requirements appear, so we always have an
up-to-date, semantic interface to create `Mechanic` objects (and the same
applies for `Car` instances).

## Example of a Builder implementation using TypeScript

Wondering how you can create that fancy builder above using TypeScript? üòè As
with many things in software development, different paths may lead to the same
result, but this approach worked very well for me in the past.

The Builder pattern is considered a _creational pattern_ since it helps us
create objects by removing all the complexity to instantiate them. So let‚Äôs
start by creating a generic `Builder<T>` interface that defines the two methods
all builders should implement: `build` (to return the object) and `save` (to
persist the object in the database). I usually add a third method, `with`, that
would allow us to pass an object with the properties we want to override. Still,
for the sake of simplicity, I will skip it in this example.

```ts
export interface Builder<T> {
  build(): T;
  save(repository: Repository<T>): Promise<T>;
}
```

Then, we may create a `BaseBuilder<T>` abstract class that implements the
`Builder<T>` interface and provides a default implementation for both methods.
The `build` method will return the object, while the `save` method will return
the object and persist it in the database. Here, we use inheritance just for
code reusability.

```ts
import { Builder } from "@test/builders";

export abstract class BaseBuilder<T> implements Builder<T> {
  protected abstract entity: T;

  public build(): T {
    return this.entity;
  }

  public save(repository: Repository<T>): Promise<T> {
    return repository.save(this.entity);
  }
}
```

Finally, we can create the `MechanicBuilder` simply by extending
`BaseBuilder<Mechanic>` and providing all the additional methods.

```ts
import { Mechanic } from "@domain";
import { BaseBuilder, CarBuilder, PtoBuilder } from "@test/builders";

export class MechanicBuilder extends BaseBuilder<Mechanic> {
  protected entity: Mechanic;

  constructor() {
    super();

    this.entity = new Mechanic({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });
  }

  public onHoliday(): this {
    this.entity.ptos = [
      new PtoBuilder().for(this.entity).on(new Date()).build(),
    ];

    return this;
  }

  public withCars(count: number): this {
    this.entity.cars = new Array(count)
      .fill(null)
      .map(() => new CarBuilder().build());

    return this;
  }
}
```

> Note how we return `this` in the `onHoliday` and `withCars` methods. That is
> the _secret sauce_ to making the Builder provide a [fluent interface][fluent]
> so that we can use it in the following way:

```ts
const mechanic = await new MechanicBuilder()
  .onHoliday()
  .withCars(5)
  .save(mechanicRepository);
```
