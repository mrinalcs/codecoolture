# React: Using children instead of dedicated render slots

Using component props to pass data (or `JSX` elements directly) that will later
populate internal UI pieces has been a prevalent pattern in the React community,
trying (probably) to emulate [the better-designed slot approach adopted by
Vue][vue-slots].

For example, imagine we are coding a new `Nav` component for our site. It will
render a collection of nav items, the page title, and a call to action link.
Each page might customize any of these elements.

Not surprisingly, I think either of these two would be the most popular examples
we might find out there (or a combination of both):

```jsx
// Passing simple data structures with the desired data
<Nav
  cta={{ text: "Buy the book!", href: "https://url.to/buy-my-book" }}
  menuItems={[
    { text: "Home", href: "/home" },
    { text: "About", href: "/about" },
    { text: "Contact", href: "/contact" },
  ]}
  title="My Site"
/>

// Passing JSX elements directly
<Nav
  cta={<a href="https://url.to/buy-my-book">Buy the book!</a>}
  menuItems={
    <>
      <li>
        <a href="/home">Home</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="/about">About</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
      </li>
    </>
  }
  title={<h1>My Site</h1>}
/>
```

Even in such as simple example, we can start seeing some of the problems with
this approach: it creeps the component API with render props, it is not very
idiomatic, and it can quickly get worse as we continue adding some more
customization for each element. For example, we may later add specific props to
styling each of the items, title, and call-to-action components:
`menuItemStyle`, `titleStyle`, `ctaStyle`, and so on:

```jsx
<Nav
  cta={{ text: "Buy the book!", href: "https://url.to/buy-my-book" }}
  ctaStyle={{ color: "red" }}
  ctaOnClick={() => alert("Thanks for buying the book!")}
  menuItems={[
    { text: "Home", href: "/home" },
    { text: "About", href: "/about" },
    { text: "Contact", href: "/contact" },
  ]}
  menuItemStyle={{ color: "blue" }}
  onMenuItemClick={(href) => alert(`Navigating to ${href}`)}
  title="My Site"
  titleStyle={{ color: "green" }}
/>
```

Let’s try a different approach. One that resembles how HTML works and that is
supported out-of-the-box by React.

## Using `children` and dedicated components

```jsx
<Nav>
  <Nav.Title>My Site</Nav.Title>

  <Nav.Menu>
    <Nav.Menu.Item href="/">Home</Nav.Menu.Item>
    <Nav.Menu.Item href="/about">About</Nav.Menu.Item>
    <Nav.Menu.Item href="/contact">Contact</Nav.Menu.Item>
  </Nav.Menu>

  <Nav.CallToAction href="https://url.to/buy-my-book">
    Buy the book!
  </Nav.CallToAction>
</Nav>
```

If you have done some React development, you probably know the `children` prop
is how React passes content down to components (for example `<p>Hola</p>`, where
`p` is the component, and `Hola` is the value of the `children` prop).

The example above uses `children` and composition extensively to render the
desired UI. Instead of passing multiple props to the `Nav` component, we create
many small, dedicated components which may of course receive their own props.

As a result, this approach gives us a much more flexible and idiomatic API. If
we later need to add additional elements to the `Nav` component, we can do so
without changing the `Nav` component at all (following the [Open-Closed design
principle][open-closed]).

On the other hand, using this technique comes with some drawbacks worth
mentioning:

- We have to make it clear that these dedicated components are only meant to be
  used as children of the `Nav` component. We can do this by using the `Nav`
  namespace, for example: `Nav.Title`, `Nav.Menu`, and `Nav.CallToAction`.
- We must ensure the `Nav` component is flexible enough to handle the different
  cases we might want to render. For example, if we want to make it possible to
  render the `Nav.Menu` component either after or before the `Nav.CallToAction`
  component, the styles should be sufficiently sophisticated to handle both
  cases.

### Possible implementation

Pay attention to how we export the `Nav` component and its dedicated components.
That’s the secret sauce to namespace them and make it clear they are only meant
to be used as children of the `Nav` component.

```jsx
const Nav = ({ children }) => {
  return <nav>{children}</nav>;
};

const CallToAction = ({ children, href }) => {
  return <a href={href}>{children}</a>;
};

const Menu = ({ children }) => {
  return <ul>{children}</ul>;
};

const MenuItem = ({ children, href }) => {
  return (
    <li>
      <a href={href}>{children}</a>
    </li>
  );
};

const Title = ({ children }) => {
  return <h1>{children}</h1>;
};

Menu.Item = MenuItem;

Nav.CallToAction = CallToAction;
Nav.Menu = Menu;
Nav.Title = Title;

export { Nav };
```

## Notes

- A few weeks after starting to write this post, I received a newsletter from
  [Kent C. Dodds][kentcdodds] featuring a React article. Coincidentally, the
  content of [the post][soul-crushing-components] covered precisely this! So,
  digging a little more, I found this pattern had been documented since a few
  years ago (watch out [this video talk][talk] from Ryan Florence at _Phoenix
  ReactJS Conf_ in 2017), and it is called **_Compound components_**.
- [Radix UI][radix] uses this pattern extensively.
- If you’re curious, I used this pattern to build the whole landing page for my
  tddworkshop.com page. You can check the source code [here][tddworkshop].

Happy hacking!
