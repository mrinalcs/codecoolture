# About me

{<Text size="l"> Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Sergio, a software engineer from Oviedo, Spain. Iâ€™ve worked in technology for over a
decade and had the luck to work in different product companies at various stages and positions (from junior engineer to
CTO!). Iâ€™m currently working at <Link href="https://github.com">GitHub</Link> as a Senior Software Engineer.</Text>}

My main interests are software design, product development (I have not only worked at product companies but also on
multiple side projects), and team leadership. I have experience coaching and mentoring software teams. Iâ€™m a strong
advocate of practices such as test-driven development (hey, [I even have a workshop about it][tddworkshop]!), continuous
delivery, and (true) Agile approaches.

In 2016 I co-founded [AsturiasHacking][asturiashacking], the first large software group in Asturias, Spain.

Did I mention Iâ€™m an occasional speaker too? Iâ€™ve given talks at national and international conferences, such as
[Codemotion Madrid][codemotion] or [Agile Testing Days Berlin][atd].

If you want to know more about me, please check out my [Mastodon feed][mastodon], [GitHub account][github], or [LinkedIn
profile][linkedin].
