# What I’m using

<Text size="l">These are some tools, platforms, apps, and services I use daily.</Text>

## Hardware

- **MacBook Pro 13-inch, 2020 (i5 2GHz Quad-Core, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)**: not especially happy with the performance of
  this machine. It overheats a lot. I will probably upgrade to a MacBook Pro with the Apple chip sooner rather than
  later.
- [**reMarkable 2**](https://remarkable.com/): loving this lil’ device. I use it for taking notes, sketching, and
  reading both eBooks and PDFs.
- [**Logitech Craft**](https://www.logitech.com/es-es/products/keyboards/craft.html): had to remap some keys, but a
  great keyboard overall.
- [**Logitech MX Master 3s**](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.html): loving this line of mice.
- [**Dell P2421D Monitor**](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-24-monitor-p2421d/apd/210-aull): not expensive,
  but sharp and reliable.
